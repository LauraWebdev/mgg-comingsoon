                            <h1>Who is creating MyGarage.games?</h1>
                            <p>Hey, my name is Laura and I'm a 23 year old developer from Germany and the lead developer. I'm the lead developer behind SpinShare, a custom content sharing website for the rhythm game Spin Rhythm XD and along with a team of dedicated developers, I've created MakerWorlds, which was the very first open platform to share and bundle up Super Mario Maker when it came out in 2015.</p>
                            <p>Along with a small team of content moderators, I've decided to announce MyGarage.games early to gather initial support for such a platform.</p>
